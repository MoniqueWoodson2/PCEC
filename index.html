        <h3>Phillips CME Church</h3>
        <p>
          Phillips Christian Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church, organized in 1865 near the close of the Civil War,
          is five years older than its denomination and the second oldest African American congregation in Huntsville.
          In 2015, Phillips celebrated its 150th Anniversary, highlighting its deep history of service, leadership, and faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Known for its pioneering Vacation Bible Schools, summer enrichment programs, and model after-school mentoring,
          Phillips has long been a cornerstone of the community. Its outreach continues today through
          <strong>Phillips Brotherhood Community Outreach (P.B.C.O.)</strong>, in collaboration with CASA, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notable members include Bishop Charles L. Russell (21st Bishop, 1938), Reverend Robert O. Langford (the denomination‚Äôs first General
          Secretary of Evangelism), and Mary Lula Shepherd (charter member of the Women‚Äôs Missionary Society).
